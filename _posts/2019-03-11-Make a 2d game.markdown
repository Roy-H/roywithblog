I made a 2d game just for fun, but I found that I have learned some new stuff from it.

Firstly, I found that UnityEngine Event is useful, and it is easy to make event trigger.
secondly, a good 2d game framework I would like to implement and make it more general to use in the next step.
Lastly, I am going to do a research regarding enemy AI, behaviour tree for example.

it make me excited and motive to continue doing this in my next plan.
