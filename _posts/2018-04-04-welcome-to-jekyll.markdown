When I first started reading about C# 3.0, one of the new features that caught
my eye was extension methods. I really like `foo.Bar()` syntax because with
auto-complete it helps users find out what methods are available for a class.
With extension methods, I could add new behavior to other classes and still
keep that calling convention. Yay.

But after thinking about it for a while, I realized there's some interesting
capabilities that this simple feature provides. While at one level, extension
methods are just [syntactic sugar](http://weblog.raganwald.com/2007/04/writing-programs-for-people-to-read.html), I think they open up the possibility
for some deeper architecture implications.
