Today I just watched a video called how to change your mindset to be successful on the youtube. Still tried to find some motivation to get out from bed and want to do something. 


Watched the NBA final this morning, Warriors beat Raptors by 1 point(106-105), it was a tremendous and exciting game for Warriors staying alive. KD banged up again, everybody was emotional for KD, He sacrificed his health for the team and the championship, and I think he deserved one.


nothing special today, keep doing the thing that I have been doing.

and I wish I could go to bed early tonight.
