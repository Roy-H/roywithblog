Today I just watched a video called how to change your mindset to be successfull on the youtube. Still tried to find some motivation to get out from bed and want to do something. 


Watched the NBA final this morning, Worriors beat Raptors by 1 point(106-105), it was a tremendous and excited game for Worriors staying alive. KD banged up again, everybody were emotional for KD, He sacrificed his health for the team and the championship, and he deserved one.


nothing special today, keep doing thing that I have been doing.

and I wish I cound go to bed early tonight.
